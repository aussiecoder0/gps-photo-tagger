#summary Compilation instructions

=== Operating system ===
 GPS Photo Tagger is primary written for Linux operating systems. I haven't tried compilation under Windows yet but I am going to make this application cross platform. But some time will be needed to develop mechanism for searching proper serial port.

=== Download sources ===
 You can download latest version of source code using SVN.

 `svn checkout http://gps-photo-tagger.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/GpsLogger GpsLogger`

=== Requirements ===
 Application is compiled by g++ compiler using included makefile. Application also uses few libraries which are needed for run and their development packages are required for compilation. Used libraries are gtkmm-2.4, exiv2, curl4, xml++-2.6 and magick++9.
